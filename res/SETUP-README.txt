To run the program, one should go to the command line console and go to the directory that contains the .jar file. The following steps illustrate this.

1. Open the command line console.
2. copy the root of the directory that contains the jar file. Suppose the directory is 

/Users/Yaufaaling/IdeaProjects/8/out/artifacts/assignment8_jar
then just copy the route.

3. use the cd command to enter the directory. More specifically, in my example, press:

cd /Users/Yaufaaling/IdeaProjects/8/out/artifacts/assignment8_jar 

and then press enter.

4. press ls to show the content in the directory. find our .jar file, assignment_8.jar

5. type the following command: 

java -jar assignment8.jar

then press enter. Our program runs.
